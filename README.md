I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science with the  [Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB)](https://www.ufpb.br). I am also a researcher intern in the [Petroleum Engineering Modelling Laboratory (LaMEP/UFPB)](http://lamep.ci.ufpb.br/). My current research lies at the intersection of Petroleum Engineering and Computer Science, this research aims to develop a tool for post-processing of oil reservoirs’ 3D models. My interests include back-end development, software development, and data science.
